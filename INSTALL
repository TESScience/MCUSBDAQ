Before this module can be used, users need permission to access the HID device
assigned to the USB-TEMP device.

On a Debian GNU/Linux system, the file 99-mcc.rules can be placed into the 
directory /etc/udev/rules.d

# cp -a 99-mcc.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/99-mcc.rules
# chown root:root /etc/udev/rules.d/99-mcc.rules
# chmod 644 /etc/udev/rules.d/99-mcc.rules
# udevadm control --reload-rules

For distributions other than Debian, the file 99-mcc.rules may need to be
modified.  Specifically, on Lines 73 and 74, that reads:

    # Enable non-root access to HID devices
    KERNEL=="hiddev*", NAME="usb/hiddev%n", MODE="0666"

The NAME must match the device name of the hiddev devices.  On some
distributions the name will just be hiddev.

    # Enable non-root access to HID devices
    KERNEL=="hiddev*", NAME="hiddev%n", MODE="0666"

WARNING: This rules file, as it currently exists, will enable all users to
access all hid devices, including the keyboard and mouse.
